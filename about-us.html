          <p>
            Friends of Columbus Park is a not for profit 501(c)3 organization based in New York City’s Manhattan Chinatown. We are one of the few organizations that recruit organizational and individual membership based on support of our mission and goals, representing a coalition of 39 community based organizations plus individual supporters and friends. We are all volunteers with no paid staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advocating for safe and clean Columbus Park is just the first of our missions. In 2002, we needed to raise awareness about Columbus Park, which is central to our community, because of the deplorable and decaying conditions of the Pavilion, ball field and park facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2004, money was raised to restore the Columbus Park Pavilion. And in 2005, thanks to Joseph Temeczko’s $1.1 Million donation, the Columbus Park ball field was upgraded with new basketball, volleyball courts and a synthetic grass field.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">These projects are just the first steps in revitalizing Columbus Park.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Chinatown parks have been ignored by the City of NY for a very long time, and we cannot rely on the City or our elected officials to maintain and preserve our open spaces. Budget cuts will continue to affect our parks. In most cases, money for parks will go to the richer neighborhoods of New York City and inner-city parks will be neglected, as always.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">It is up to you, the people in our community, to get involved and help make a difference in the quality of life here in Chinatown. This starts with our parks and open spaces.</span>

          <h2>Sharing A Vision for A Better Chinatown</h2>
        </div>  <!-- end of section-title div -->
        <div class="thirds-sidebar-container">
          <div class="two-thirds-module">
            <h4>It Begins With Our Youth</h4>
            <p>
              Start with the realization that the future for a better NY Chinatown lies with our youth, for they will grow up to be our future leaders and dreamers for a strong and better NY Chinatown.
            </p>
            <h4>We Need to Find a Place to SHARE & GROW as a COMMUNITY</h4>
            <p>
              Our vision is to build a Community Center that can serve our community, primarily our <span class="bold">Youth</span> (as they need a place to go) and our <span class="bold">Seniors</span> (as they have no place else to go).
            </p>
            <p>
              Real estate in NY Chinatown is expensive, and there is only one place that we can look at as a possible place for a "Community Center." That place can be the <span class="bold">Columbus Park Pavilion</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pavilion is in a park, easy to find, has trees and greenery surrounding it, has two bathrooms (lower level), a small community room, and an adequate open area in the upper loggia of the facility. It is a place that has basketball courts, volleyball courts, synthetic grass (for soccer and football, etc.), a playground, bathrooms, vending machines, a Park House, and it is all residing in Columbus Park, NY Chinatown.
            </p>
            <h4>What Can a Community Center Do for Our Community? Imagine This.</h4>
            <p><span class="emphasis">Close your eyes and imagine this vision for:</span></p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>A place where your kids and grandsons can come to learn, play and meet others.</li>
                <li>A place seniors can gather and exercise indoors, play games, teach and promote culture, get information, and talk about things.</li>
                <li>A place that does not discriminate, does not care about skin color or religion, a place that doesn't care about who you know and what you do.</li>
                <li>A place where people can share their thoughts, knowledge, talents and resources.</li>
                <li>A place that has a set of rules that "everyone" must follow.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="emphasis">With a community center, we can have:</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Scheduled movies, shows and performances</li>
                <li>Educational workshops and seminars</li>
                <li>Information/Tourist/Visitors Center</li>
                <li>Relaxation/Concessions (small) area for park users</li>
                <li>Town Hall Meetings (discuss issues affecting our community)/Open Forums</li>
                <li>Display of neighborhood History/Culture/Information</li>
                <li>Station neighborhood tours</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>What needs to be done to accomplish this vision?</h4>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Give the community the keys. The community needs to be able to co-manage the pavilion with the City of NY Parks Department.</li>
                <li>Establish rules and guidelines for running the pavilion.</li>
                <li>Hire support staff and procure funding.</li>
                <li>Enclose the upper loggia of the pavilion to protect it from nature's decay.</li>
                <li>Install heating and air conditioning in the upper loggia of the pavilion so that we can use the building all year round, including weekends and evenings.</li>
                <li>Get political support from our community, the Mayor's office, MBPO and the City Council.</li>
              </ol>

          <h4>How It All Began</h4>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">September 5, 2001:</span> Led by City Councilman elect Alan J. Gerson and concerned community groups, a press conference was held in front of the Columbus Park Pavilion to raise public awareness of the horrible conditions of the pavilion. The pavilion, neglected by the City of New York and community leaders of NY Chinatown had been closed to the general public for several years and had become a nesting ground for hundreds of pigeons.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">January 2002:</span> FoCP received its 501(c)3 status, operating as an all-volunteer, not-for-profit, community-based organization in Chinatown, NY.

            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">May 2002:</span> Helped to organize support of the NY Chinatown community for the NYC Parks & Recreation Department's proposal of an Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program (UPARR) grant of $1M to restore the Columbus Park Pavilion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">October 30, 2002:</span> Organized members of the community to inspect the overall conditions of the lower and upper levels of the Pavilion.

              </li>

                <span class="bold">June 29, 2003:</span> Organized an event for kids in the community to help clean up Columbus Park.

              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">June 2004:</span> NYC Parks invites FoCP and other community organizations to meet at the park to discuss their plans for renovation of the ball field. They shared plans to replace the asphalt with synthetic turf (fake grass), which was met with skepticism and unanswered questions. This led FoCP to begin a campaign against the installation of synthetic turf.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">August 2004:</span> FoCP campaigned for the installation of an all-purpose field that would serve more of the community, in place of the proposed synthetic grass. A petition drive secured 3,505 names and 405 businesses in favor of a multi-purpose turf.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">October 2004:</span> Reached a negotiated settlement with NYC Parks, which included dividing the field with approximately half being synthetic turf and half being all-purpose asphalt. The asphalt section would include the installation of 3 1/2 basketball courts and 3 volleyball courts.
