            Hi Everyone,
          </p>
          <p class="narrow">
            Since 2002, Friends of Columbus Park (FoCP) has been involved in issues concerning our park. Our primary focus has always been to advocate for a safe and clean park that can adequately serve our kids, seniors and the general public in our community. Like many community organizations we began because there was a need that needed fixing.
          </p>
          <p class="narrow">
            That need focused around the <span class=”bold”>Columbus Park Pavilion</span>, which has been closed and left to decay in the park for over 30 years. During this time, the only ones using the Pavilion were the hundreds of park pigeons that flew and nested in and around the Pavilion, and the neighborhood homeless that used the Pavilion at night as a homeless shelter. Occasionally, the community and visitors would use the surrounding trees and corners of the Pavilion as their public bathroom whenever they needed to go.
          </p>
          <p class="narrow">
            This prompted me to submit the Columbus Park Pavilion as one of the sorriest public sites in NYC, sending photos with a brief statement of the deplorable conditions of the Columbus Park Pavilion. To my surprise, the Pavilion was nominated into the <a href="https://www.pps.org/places/columbus-park-pavilion">"Hall of Shame"</a> by the Projects for Public Spaces, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people create and sustain public spaces that build strong communities.
          </p>
          <p class="narrow">
            The Columbus Park Pavilion in NY Chinatown finally got some press.
          </p>
          <p class="narrow">
            <span class="bold">Why was the Columbus Park Pavilion put in the Hall of Shame?</span>
            <ul class="narrow">
              <li>Totally inaccessible &ndash; it's fenced off and locked.</li>
              <li>It has become home for the hundreds of pigeons in the area.</li>
              <li>Nothing goes on here, although the rest of the park has lots of activity.</li>
              <li>It could be a thriving community place and a focal point for the park, but needs work.</li>
            </ul>
