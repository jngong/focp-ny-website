              Bobby Lee died in November of 2004 at 84 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
              I met Bobby at the Columbus Park ball field while he was doing his morning exercise of Chinese Martial Arts. He was a retired senior citizen and lived across the street from Columbus Park, NY Chinatown.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bobby was instrumental in organizing seniors and users of the Columbus Park ball field against the synthetic turf (fake grass) project proposed by the City of New York. He formed and became president of the "Columbus Park Exercise Group." This group, which numbered close to 400 members organized and campaigned together with Friends of Columbus Park in our efforts against the installation of synthetic turf at the Columbus park ball field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bobby attended all our meetings and advocated strongly for public park space that seniors can use. He pointed out that parks are not only for kids and teenagers, but also for seniors that use the park for daily exercise. He often said that: While kids and other users have the mobility to go from place to place, seniors have nowhere else to go, and they need adequate park space that they can use for exercise and general open space benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the campaign against synthetic turf at Columbus Park, it was Bobby who constantly pointed out that it was "asphalt" not "turf" which was the preferred surface for seniors to exercise on.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all need to remember Bobby Lee and his efforts. He loved Columbus Park and his community. He enjoyed the  camaraderie of exercising together with fellow seniors and working together with all the members and friends of Friends of Columbus Park. He often said to me: "It's important for all of us to work together for NY Chinatown, to fight for what is right in our community."
            </p>
            <p>
              I miss Bobby as a friend and respected ally. I wish his family well and for me he will never be forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>
              With respect and love for a friend and ally!

          <p class="section-intro">Founder of the NY Cruisers Athletic Association</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Robert is a NY Chinatown Community Resident, never to be forgotten. He passed away on Saturday, December 30, 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert was an individual dedicated to the kids of NY Chinatown and founded the NY Cruisers in 1980. He has been an icon in NY Chinatown Asian basketball and a strong supporter of establishing a "Youth Center" in the NY Chinatown area. He was active in Friends of Columbus Park's activities, participating in our "Sports for KIDS" program at PS 124, showing films in the park and being active in trying to make NY Chinatown a better place to live. Please join us as we honor and remember Robert Lee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The North American Chinese Basketball Association (NACBA) published an article in their magazine associated with their 27th annual tournament (May 25-29, 2007) remembering Robert Lee and his legacy in New York’s Chinatown and as part of Asian American basketball history.

          <h2>Albert K. Sun</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I've known Albert since my college days in City College (1970s), and have played basketball against him and with him as teammates. We've won and lost games together. He was truly a gentleman, a caring person, a great teammate and friend. He was to me a gentle giant on the basketball court and in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          His physical traits were SLOW MOVING and HUGE BASKETBALL PLAYER (6'4, and at least 250 lbs – the biggest guy in Chinatown) that could not be budged, and a GREAT LOW POST SCORER (ONLY when he was younger...). As we got older, we BOTH got slower and slower, since I was just as big as Albert but 8 inches shorter, and we both loved Basketball.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, did I mention that Albert was a GENTLE GIANT on the BB Court? Well, that was not entirely true. You see, in basketball, the bigger you are, the more you get butchered and hit, and Albert always got butchered and hit. The funny thing is that when he was young, he took all the hits with a smile, but as he got older he learned to hit back, scream and yell "Bloody Foul." I'd laugh inside as I tried to calm him down, but Albert sometimes could be very stubborn. Like all of us OLD GUYS playing BB, our model today is "DON'T TOUCH ME," just let us do our thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember in 1998, when I and others founded the Asian American Youth Center (AAYC) in NY Chinatown. Albert was the first to contribute to our cause (Establish a Youth/Community Center in NY Chinatown). Albert will always be remembered as gracious and caring.
