            <p>
              The mission for the Sports for Kids program is to build stronger communities for our kids through sportsmanship, exercise and team work. The future vision is to expand our current basketball teaching clinic to more sports, e.g. volleyball, baseball and soccer, running in all our neighborhood schools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Team sports are important for kids at an early age to foster values such as team work, discipline and respect. At our weekly clinics, we teach kids how to play basketball with a focus on these values. They also give kids an opportunity to learn, play and have fun together!

            <p>
              Hosted in partnership with Asian American Youth Center (AAYC), our annual Senior Day event is an opportunity for us to celebrate and thank our seniors for a lifetime of giving.
            </p>
            <p>
              The seniors in our community have been the lifeline to our culture and our family virtues. As their sons and daughters, we owe them so much and many times we don't have a chance to say "thank you."
            </p>
            <p>
              Senior day is a special day just for them to enjoy &mdash; play games, win prizes, enjoy food and performances!

            <p>
              The Jacquelynn Young Inspiration Scholarship is awarded to graduating seniors of select local NYC high schools. Jacquelynn's mother set up the scholarship in 2004 to honor the memory of Jackie, as she was known to her family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within the first three years of the program, seven one-time awards were granted to graduating seniors of Francis Lewis High School in Queens, where Jackie was a student, based on essays that embodied the community spirit and faith in people that Jackie had.
